# AltSchool of Cloud Engineering Tinyuka 2023 Capstone Project

## Overview

This project involves deploying the Socks Shop, a microservices-based application, on a Kubernetes cluster using Infrastructure as Code (IaaC) principles. The project aims to demonstrate the deployment of a modern cloud-native application with an emphasis on automation, monitoring, and security. The deployment was carried out on **Azure**, using **Terraform** for IaaC and **Helm** for managing Kubernetes resources.
